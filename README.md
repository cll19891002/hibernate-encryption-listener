# About the project
The project is a showcase for the following article: https://blog.arnoldgalovics.com/encrypting-jpa-entity-attributes-using-listeners-in-spring

It shows how to use JPA with Spring to do database encryption and decryption without explicitly handling it.
The main goal was to show how to use event listeners in Hibernate to achieve this behavior
and additionally to handle Spring's dependency injection in these listeners.
